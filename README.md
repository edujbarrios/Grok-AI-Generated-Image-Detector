# Detecting AI-Generated Images by Grok

This project aims to identify whether an image is real or generated by Grok's AI tools. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch for robust image analysis. The steps include image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts images to grayscale, detects edges, and resizes them for consistent input.
- **Custom Dataset Class**: Handles loading and preprocessing images from directories.
- **CNN Model**: Built using PyTorch, the model identifies patterns associated with AI-generated images.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Efficient training and validation pipeline to ensure high accuracy.
- **Prediction Capability**: Easily predict if an input image is real or AI-generated.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later.
2. Libraries: Install the required Python libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Dataset Preparation
Organize your dataset into the following structure:
```
dataset/
├── real_images/       # Directory containing real images
├── generated_images/  # Directory containing images generated by Grok
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Download and open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps to preprocess images, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

## Usage

### Training the Model
Run the `train_model` function to train the model on your dataset. Ensure you have a sufficient number of images in both `real_images` and `generated_images` directories.

### Evaluating the Model
After training, use the `evaluate_model` function to calculate the model's accuracy on the test dataset.

### Making Predictions
Use the `predict_image` function to predict whether an image contains AI-generated content or is real. Example:
```python
image_path = "test_image.jpg"
prediction = predict_image(image_path, model)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

## File Descriptions
- **`Grok_Detector.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
- **`grok_detector_model.pth`**: Saved PyTorch model file for reuse.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve detection robustness for diverse image datasets.
- Integrate support for identifying other AI-generated content beyond Grok.
- Build a web interface for easy image upload and prediction.
